I'm an assistant professor at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr) and belong to the [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr) laboratory.

My current topics of research are in two different fields. On one side in
computational neuroscience, investigating emergent properties of interconnected
assemblies of simple units and on the other side on the development of machine
learning based methodologies applied in different fields (e.g. forestry,
ecology).
