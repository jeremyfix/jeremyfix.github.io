Just noticed that the latest releases of pytorch, if installed using `pip`, do not support NVidia GPUs with Volta micro-architectures.

A table mapping the pytorch version with the micro-architecture being supported is proposed on [https://github.com/moi90/pytorch_compute_capabilities/blob/main/table_pip.md](https://github.com/moi90/pytorch_compute_capabilities/blob/main/table_pip.md).

Starting from version 2.8.0, NVidia GPUs such as 1080 and 1080Ti and basically all that have a [compute capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) lower than 7.0 are no more supported.
