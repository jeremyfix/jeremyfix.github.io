After working for a while with vim, I'm currently giving a try to neovim. This blog post contains notes on my first steps and discovery of plugins. I believe I will pretty quickly forget about the steps I followed to set this up :) 

The **rc** file of neovim is a lua script `init.lua` you find in `.config/nvim/init.lua`. Mine is bascially only containing the plugin manager Lazy.nvim :

```.lua
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  vim.fn.system({
    "git",
    "clone",
    "--filter=blob:none",
    "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
    "--branch=stable", -- latest stable release
    lazypath,
  })
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)

require("vim-options")
require("lazy").setup("plugins")
```

This will also trigger loading the `.config/nvim/lua/vim-options.lua` and `.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua` files. The `vim-options` file contains some shortcuts, definitions of tabstop, expandtab, etc..  

The plugins file only contains `return {}` but I believe will trigger loading all the plugins in the `.config/nvim/lua/plugins` directory.

## Installing a Nerd Font

We can have very nice icons within nvim, especially with the Neotree plugin, after having installed a patched font from the [Nerd font project](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). In my case, I just download the Ubuntu Nerd font. You have to :

- download the zip
- extract the zip into `.fonts/`
- run the command `fc-cache -fv`

and that's it. Combined with the [nvim-neo-tree](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim), you get a nice file explorer. For the configuration of neo-tree, here is the `plugins/neo-tree.lua` file :

```.lua
return {
	"nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim",
	branch = "v3.x",
	dependencies = {
		"nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
		"nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
		"MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
	},
	config = function()
		vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-n>", ":Neotree filesystem reveal left<CR>", {})
		vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>o", ":Neotree buffers reveal float<CR>", {})
	end,
}
```

Where my `<leader>o` shows the buffer list. I believe it is `devicons` that display the icons embedded in the patched font.

## Greeting page with alpha

The `alpha-nvim` plugin configures the starting page of nvim

## Language Server Protocols

LSP are the way to have custom functionalities depending on the language you are coding with. I used [nvim-lspconfig]() with [mason.nvim]() and [mason-lspconfig]() doing the bridge. Following the README of `mason-lspconfig` and adding few LSP by default leads to the following `plugins/lsp-config.lua`

```.lua
return
{
    "mason-org/mason-lspconfig.nvim",
    opts = {
      ensure_installed = { "lua_ls", "rust_analyzer", "basedpyright" }
    },
    dependencies = {
        { "mason-org/mason.nvim", opts = {} },
        "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
    },
}
```
