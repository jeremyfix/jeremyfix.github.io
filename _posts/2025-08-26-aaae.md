At the [Gretsi 2025](https://gretsi.fr/colloque2025/), one session was about
inverse problems. An example inverse problem involves find a high-dimensional
signal $$x$$ from low dimensional observations $$y$$ under a linear model $$y = A x +z$$ where $$z$$ is a measurement noise, $$A$$ the sensing matrix.

One approach involves compressed sensing where you try to decompose your signal
as the combination of the smallest number of dictionnary elements. In this
family of approachs, {% cite
Newson2023 %} proposed latent auto-encoders.
